  > Most novel about the new market metaphors was their detachment from history and institutions and from questions of power. As the market grew more abstract, society thinned out into highly reduced microeconomic mental pictures: Gilder's heroically independent entrepreneurs, Lucas's forward-looking utility maximizers, Wanniski's fish and coconut traders, the Coase theorem's rancher and farmer maximizing the public good as they stood on the courthouse steps. To imagine the market now was to imagine a socially detached array of economic actors, free to choose and optimize, unconstrained by power or inequalities, governed not by their common deliberative action but only by the impersonal laws of the market.
