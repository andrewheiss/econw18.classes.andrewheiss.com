# Paper airplanes and diminishing marginal product

Here's the average production function from both sections (yay 8:00 AM section!):

<figure class="fullwidth">

```{r airplanes-class-avg, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
library(tidyverse)
source(file.path(here::here(), "lib", "graphics.R"))

planes_class <- read_csv(file.path(here::here(), "static", "data", "airplanes-class.csv"),
                         col_types = "cccii") %>%
  mutate(Round = paste("Round", Round),
         Section = paste(Section, "class"))

planes_by_round <- planes_class %>%
  group_by(Workers, Section) %>%
  summarize(Airplanes = mean(Airplanes))

ggplot(planes_by_round, aes(x = Workers, y = Airplanes)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "grey60") +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = Section), method = "lm", formula = y ~ log(x), 
              se = FALSE, color = nord_dk_blue, size = 1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1, 10), ylim = c(0, 20)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, 2)) +
  labs(x = "Number of workers per firm", y = "Average number of airplanes",
       title = "Average number of airplanes produced by 8 firms",
       subtitle = "Four rounds played",
       caption = "MPA 612, Winter 2018\nRomney Institute of Public Management\nBrigham Young University") +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~ Section)
```

</figure>

And here's the by-round production function (yay learning!):

<figure class="fullwidth">

```{r airplanes-class-by-round, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
ggplot(planes_class, aes(x = Workers, y = Airplanes, color = Round)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(planes_class, Round %in% c("Round 1", "Round 4")),
              method = "lm", formula = y ~ log(x), se = FALSE, size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(data = planes_by_round, method = "lm", formula = y ~ log(x), 
              aes(group = Section),
              size = 1, color = "grey60", se = FALSE, linetype = "dashed") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1, 10), ylim = c(0, 25)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 10, 2)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(nord_dk_blue, nord_purple, nord_yellow, nord_orange),
                     name = NULL) +
  labs(x = "Number of workers per firm", y = "Number of airplanes produced",
       title = "Number of airplanes produced by 8 firms, by round",
       subtitle = "Four rounds played",
       caption = "MPA 612, Winter 2018\nRomney Institute of Public Management\nBrigham Young University") +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  facet_wrap(~ Section)
```
