# International Trade Game

This game was originally developed by the international NGO Action Aid and [adapted by Dr. John Sloman from the University of the West of England](https://www.economicsnetwork.ac.uk/showcase/sloman_game).

## Results

```{r calc-results, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(pander)
library(ggstance)
library(here)

source(file.path(here(), "lib", "graphics.R"))

results <- tribble(
  ~section, ~team, ~total,
  "8:00",   "A1",  17700,
  "8:00",   "A2",  7400,
  "8:00",   "B1",  26900,
  "8:00",   "C1",  26100,
  "8:00",   "C2",  21700,
  "9:30",   "A1",  51400,
  "9:30",   "A2",  130750,
  "9:30",   "B1",  41700,
  "9:30",   "C1",  0,
  "9:30",   "C2",  24950
) %>%
  mutate(team = fct_inorder(team, ordered = TRUE) %>% fct_rev())

results_summary <- results %>%
  group_by(section, team) %>%
  summarise(`Total earnings` = sum(total)) %>%
  mutate(`% of world earnings` = `Total earnings` / sum(`Total earnings`)) %>%
  arrange(desc(`% of world earnings`)) %>%
  mutate(total = `Total earnings`)
```

In the 8:00 section, lower income countries (C1 and C2) vastly outperformed the rich countries (A1 and A2). In the 9:30 section, both A1 and A2 outperformed everyone else. A1 and C1 merged countries (hence C1's $0 outcome), and A2 blew everyone away, earning more than 50% of the total global output.

```{r plot-results, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(results, aes(x = total, y = team, color = fct_rev(section))) +
  geom_pointrangeh(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = total), size = 0.75,
                   position = position_dodgev(height = 0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(nord_dk_blue, nord_red), name = NULL,
                     guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs(x = "Final earnings", y = NULL) +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom")
```

```{r table-results, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
results_summary %>%
  select(Section = section, Country = team, everything(), -total) %>%
  mutate(`Total earnings` = scales::dollar(`Total earnings`),
         `% of world earnings` = scales::percent(`% of world earnings`)) %>%
  pandoc.table()
```

\

This distribution of wealth created a society with a Gini coefficient of `r ineq::Gini(results_summary$total) %>% round(2)`:

```{r plot-gini, echo=FALSE}
get_lorenz <- function(x) {
  lorenz_raw <- ineq::Lc(x)
  data_frame(prop_population = lorenz_raw$p,
             prop_income = lorenz_raw$L)
}

earnings_lc <- get_lorenz(results_summary$`Total earnings`)

ggplot(data = earnings_lc) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = prop_population,
                  ymin = prop_income,
                  ymax = prop_population),
              fill = nord_red, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = prop_population, y = prop_income),
            size = 2, color = nord_red) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, size = 0.5, color = "grey50") +
  labs(x = "Cumulative % of population", y = "Cumulative % of income") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::percent, breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::percent, breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2)) +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "black", size = 0.25))
```
