**Submit your two-page memo and your project report on Learning Suite.**

All the materials you need for your final project are on Learning Suite under Content > Final project. 

You **may** work with other students on the calculations, recommendations, distributional ramifications, and the like, but you **must** submit your own memo and report, written by you and solely by you.
