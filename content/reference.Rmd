# Citations and bibliography

[^bibtex] You can [download a BibTeX file](/bib/references.bib) of all the non-web-based readings in the course. I will update it periodically throughout the semester.

[^bibtex]: {-} You can open the file in [BibDesk on macOS](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/), [JabRef on Windows](http://www.jabref.org/), or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) online.
